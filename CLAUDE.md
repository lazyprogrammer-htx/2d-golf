# Development Rules

## Core Principles
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** - Write code once, reuse everywhere
- **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)** - Simple solutions over complex ones
- **Junior-friendly** - Code should be readable and maintainable

## Guidelines
- Use clear, descriptive variable and function names
- Prefer built-in functions over custom implementations
- Break complex problems into smaller, manageable functions
- Comment only when the "why" isn't obvious from the code
- Choose established patterns over clever solutions
- Test early and often with simple test cases
