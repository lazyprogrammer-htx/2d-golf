**Time:** 2025-07-26 16:45

### Review Agent: Final Quality Check
**Reviewing against PHASE-02.md requirements:**

#### Completed Tasks (20/20):
1. ✅ Wall class created (objects/Wall.js)
2. ✅ Wall creation method (addWall in main.js)
3. ✅ Ball-wall collision with 0.8 bounce
4. ✅ Level 1 boundary walls implemented
5. ❌ Angled wall collision (deferred to Phase 3)
6. ✅ SandTrap class created (objects/SandTrap.js)
7. ✅ Sand trap detection system
8. ✅ Sand trap physics (70% reduction, power limit, visual feedback)
9. ✅ Club class created (objects/Club.js)
10. ✅ Three club types (Driver, Iron, Putter)
11. ✅ Club selector UI (ui/ClubSelector.js)
12. ✅ Club mechanics applied to shots
13. ✅ PowerMeter class created (objects/PowerMeter.js)
