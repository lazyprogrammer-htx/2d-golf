**Phase 3 Readiness:** Well-documented for future implementation  

### Communication Protocol

#### Inter-Agent Communication:
- Update `/home/geoff/dev/2d-golf/tasks/comms/2/INTER-AGENT-COMMS.md` with:
  - Verification progress status
  - Any issues discovered during testing
  - Performance metrics and observations
  - Recommendations for Phase 3

#### Status Reporting:
- Update `/home/geoff/dev/2d-golf/tasks/tracking/2/STATUS.md` with:
  - Final verification results
  - Any minor fixes or improvements made
  - Confirmation of Phase 3 readiness

### Next Steps After Verification

#### If Verification Passes (Expected):
1. Confirm Task 2 completion status
2. Document any minor improvements made
3. Provide Phase 3 readiness confirmation
4. Archive Task 2 as successfully completed

#### If Issues Found (Unlikely):
1. Document specific issues discovered
2. Create targeted fix plan for critical issues
3. Update completion status appropriately
4. Ensure no blockers for Phase 3

### Dependencies for Phase 3

#### Assets Ready for Phase 3:
- ✅ Complete wall collision system (minus angled walls)
- ✅ Full terrain effects system (sand traps)
- ✅ Complete club mechanics with three types
- ✅ Visual feedback systems (power meter)
- ✅ Game state management (controls, counters)
- ✅ Modular, extensible architecture

#### Integration Points for Phase 3:
- Level design system can utilize existing wall/trap classes
- Additional club types can extend current Club.js implementation  
- New obstacles can follow SandTrap.js pattern
- Sound system can integrate with existing event triggers
- Advanced UI can build upon current ClubSelector.js foundation

## Conclusion

Task 2 (Phase 2: Game Mechanics) has been successfully completed with 19/20 tasks implemented to a high standard. The implementation demonstrates excellent code quality, follows all development principles, and provides a solid foundation for Phase 3 development. 

The current execution plan focuses on thorough verification and validation to ensure the implementation is robust and ready for the next development phase. The single deferred task (angled wall collision) does not impact the core gameplay experience and has been appropriately moved to Phase 3.

**Recommendation:** Proceed with verification testing to confirm completion status and authorize transition to Phase 3 development.
