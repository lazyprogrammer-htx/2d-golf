2. **objects/SandTrap.js** - Sand trap class with overlap detection
3. **objects/Club.js** - Club class with power/accuracy mechanics
4. **objects/PowerMeter.js** - Visual power meter with gradient
5. **ui/ClubSelector.js** - Club selection UI component

### Modified Files (2):
1. **main.js** - Integration of all new systems
2. **index.html** - Added script references

### Test Files (1):
1. **test-validation-task2.html** - Comprehensive test suite

## Implementation Details

### Agent 1: Wall System ✅
- Physics-enabled walls with 0.8 bounce
- Level 1 boundary walls implemented
- Proper collision detection with ball

### Agent 2: Sand Trap System ✅
- Visual sand traps with beige color and transparency
- Overlap detection without physics collision
- 70% velocity reduction when ball enters sand
- 50% max power limitation in sand
- Visual feedback (ball darkening)

### Agent 3: Club System ✅
- Three club types with different properties:
  - **Driver**: 1.5x power, ±5° accuracy
  - **Iron**: 1.0x power, ±2° accuracy  
  - **Putter**: 0.5x power, perfect accuracy
- Interactive UI selector on left side
- Power multiplier and accuracy spread mechanics
- Visual feedback showing selected club

### Agent 4: Power Meter ✅
- Visual power meter at bottom center (400, 550)
- Color gradient: green → yellow → orange → red
- Shows/hides during aiming
- Integrates with club power calculations
- Percentage display with glow effects

### Agent 5: Game Controls ✅
- Shot counter in top-right corner
- Retry button in top-left corner with hover effects
- Ball reset functionality
- Shot increment on each shot
- Proper state management

## Testing Results
